# NoSQL-Social-Network-API

## Task

For this challenge, I was given the task of building an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends` thoughts, and create a friend list. I have used Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the Express.js and Mongoose packages, I have used the native JavaScript date object to format timestamps.
